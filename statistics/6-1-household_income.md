>> The mean and median are (74278.70753118733, 51226.45447894046). The skewness and Pearson's skewness are (4.949920244429583, 0.7361258019141782). About 66% of households report a taxable income below the mean. The results depend on the assumed upper bound because since that number is far above the mean, it has a strong influence over the mean, skewing it to the right. The higher that upper bound, the more the mean is pulled to the right, and the overall distribution is skewed to the right.
