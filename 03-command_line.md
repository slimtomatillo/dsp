# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > `pwd` = show current working directory path  
> > `mkdir` = `mkdir` + `newdirectory` will create a directory  
> > `rm -r` = `rm -r` + `directory` will delete a directory and all of its contents  
> > `rmdr` = `rmdr` + `directory` will delete an empty directory  
> > `touch` = `touch` + `file` will create a file  
> > `rm` = `rm` + `file` will delete a file  
> > `mv` = rename a specified file or directory (or move file)  
> > `ls -a` = list hidden files  
> > `cp` = `cp` + `file` + `directory` copy specified file to specified directory  
> > `echo` = outputs the string of the argument being passed  
> > `ls` = list files in the current working directory  
> > `cat` = displays contents of a file  
> > `cd` = change directory  
> > `history` - displays listing of the last commands run

> > `ls -lh` = list files and use a long listing format with sizes printed in human readable format (e.g., 4K 34M 7G)  
> > `ls -lah` = list all files including hidden . files in long listing format with sizes printed in human readable format  
> > `ls -t` = list files and sort by time, defaults to modification time
